# Algerian Forest Fire Prediction Machine learning Project.

The Machine Learning methods have successfully reached
the primacy as a replacement to the traditional field-survey methods for the prediction of forest fire
susceptibility by elucidating the relationship between historic fire events and different explanatory
variables in order to predict future fires.

## Description 



To develop a suite of predictive model I have worked on Decision tree classifier,
GradientBoosting Classifier,SVM, KNN classifier,Random Forest classifier and based on accuracy score
I develop model using Random Forest classifier for the prediction of fire susceptibility.
## Deployment

I have used Heroku to deploy this project.
